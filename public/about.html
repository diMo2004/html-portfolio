    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p style="font-style:oblique">
        Hi, I am a student at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Pune
        currently pursuing Computer Science Engineering.<br>
        I am interested in learning web development and building websites.
        I look forward to it as a great opportunity for advancement in my
        career. I have developed two websites as projects for now which are:<br>
        <ul style="font-style: bold;">
            <li>Favourite Movie Project</li>
            <li>Birthday Invite Project</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-style:oblique">
            I look forward to explore more in this field.
            <br>
            <br>
            Thank you!
        </p>
